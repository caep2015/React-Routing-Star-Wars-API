## App Description  
In this project, you will start creating a Star Wars API explorer app. To achieve this, you will need to implement:
* routing
* links
* browser history
* component nesting
We have set up the basic structure and functionality of the app for you.

## Instructions  
The following functionality still needs to be implemented:
1. Routing, including an exact route to the home page.
2. Browser history.
3. Links and `NavLinks`.
4. Style the home page link using 'activeStyle'.
5. Component nesting in `BaseLayout`
6. Component imports in `BaseLayout`

You'll be working with the following files:
* index.js
* layouts.js
* explorer.js
* people.js
* starships.js
* films.js
There are detailed instructions in each file.

### Routing Instructions  
* Routing logic needs to be located in index.js.
  * Import `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, `Switch` from react-router-dom.
  * Import additional pages.
  * Nest `BaseLayout` within `BrowserRouter`.
  * Nest `Switch` within `BaseLayout`.
  * Nest `Route` components within `Switch`
  * Set paths for each Route component.
  * Set home page path using exact.
* NavLinks
  * Import `NavLink` in `BaseLayout`.
  * Set appropriate `NavLinks` in the nav.

## Getting started  

1. Download the zip file, and place where you keep projects
2. Change directories into the project
3. Install the dependencies - `npm install`
4. Fire up the server - `npm start`

## Your role as a student
Articulate their ideas as best you can. Try to facilitate effective collaboration with your paired student. Be willing to debate strategies for how best to approach your challenge, but donâ€™t allow endless debate to keep you from making progress. Keep your eye on the clock and try to work yourself through the challenge at a reasonable pace. You and your partner should share the responsibility for authoring ideas and code. Finish your challenge and make certain that you call talk someone through the logic and strategies implemented by your group.
